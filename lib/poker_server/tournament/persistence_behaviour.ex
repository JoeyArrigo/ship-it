  Behaviour contract for tournament persistence operations.
  
  This behavior enables clean separation between test and production environments:
  - Production: Synchronous, blocking persistence to ensure data consistency
  - Test: No-op implementation to avoid database coupling
  
  The interface ensures that persistence operations are either completely successful
  or fail fast, maintaining the requirement that persisted events â‰¥ game state.
