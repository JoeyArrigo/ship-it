- **Phase 1 Critical Issues:** 1/4 completed (25%)
- **Total Issues Resolved:** 1/12 (8.3%)
- **Last Updated:** Multi-player all-in side pots implemented

## Status Legend
- üî• **Critical** - Could break in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High** - Important edge cases

## Critical Issues (üî•)

### 1. Multi-player All-in Side Pot Calculations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex:side_pots/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced simple 2-pot algorithm with layer-based approach
- Handles any number of all-in players with different bet amounts
- Creates correct number of side pots with proper eligible players
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing scenarios

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Complex 4-player scenario creating 3 side pots
- All players all-in with different amounts
- Validates correct pot distribution and eligible players
- All 75 tests pass including new comprehensive side pot tests

**Commit:** `40c7669` - Implement robust multi-player all-in side pot calculations

### 2. Button Position with Multiple Eliminations üî•
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Risk Level:** Critical - Could crash game  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:eliminate_players/1`

**Problem:** If button + consecutive players are eliminated, button position may become invalid.

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Button player eliminated with next 2+ players
- All but 2 players eliminated simultaneously
- Button position >= remaining player count

---

### 3. Blind Posting with Insufficient Chips üî•
**Status:** Not handled  
**Risk Level:** Critical - Game could hang  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:start_hand/1`

**Problem:** No handling for players who can't afford blind amounts.

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Small blind player has fewer chips than required
- Big blind player has fewer chips than required
- Both blind players have insufficient chips

---

### 4. Concurrent Game Operations üî•
**Status:** Not tested  
**Risk Level:** Critical - Race conditions  
**Location:** All GenServer modules

**Problem:** No testing of concurrent access to game state.

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Multiple players acting simultaneously
- Game creation during active hand
- Player disconnection during betting

---

## High Priority Issues (‚ö†Ô∏è)

### 5. Deck Exhaustion ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Not handled  
**Risk Level:** High - Game crash  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/deck.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Running out of cards during dealing
- Invalid deck state recovery
- Community card dealing with insufficient cards

---

### 6. Invalid Input Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Minimal validation  
**Risk Level:** High - Security risk

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Negative chip amounts
- Malformed card data
- Invalid player IDs
- Out-of-bounds positions

---

### 7. Short Deck Straight Edge Cases ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Risk Level:** High - Incorrect hand rankings  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/hand_evaluator.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- A-6-7-8-9 straight (lowest in short deck)
- Wheel straight variations
- Mixed straight comparisons

---

### 8. Kicker Comparisons ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Basic implementation  
**Risk Level:** High - Incorrect winners

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Two pair with identical pairs, different kickers
- Three of a kind kicker comparisons
- Full house comparisons (trips vs pair)

---

## Medium Priority Issues (üìù)

### 9. Heads-up Betting Rules üìù
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Big blind option to raise pre-flop
- Small blind acts first pre-flop
- Post-flop action order

---

### 10. Minimum Raise Enforcement üìù
**Status:** Basic implementation  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Undersized raise prevention
- All-in less than minimum raise
- Reopening betting action

---

### 11. String Betting Prevention üìù
**Status:** Not implemented

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Multiple betting actions in sequence
- Action timeout handling
- Undo invalid actions

---

### 12. Tournament Features üìù
**Status:** Not implemented

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Blind level increases
- Prize pool distribution
- Final table dynamics
- Player elimination notifications

## Notes for Implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Use property-based testing for edge cases
- Implement stress tests for concurrent scenarios
- Create comprehensive test fixtures for complex all-in scenarios
- Add performance benchmarks for critical paths

### Code Review Focus Areas
- Side pot calculation logic
- Button position arithmetic
- Chip validation before operations
- State consistency after operations
