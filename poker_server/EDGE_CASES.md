## Critical Issues (üî•)

### 1. Multi-player All-in Side Pot Calculations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex:side_pots/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced simple 2-pot algorithm with layer-based approach
- Handles any number of all-in players with different bet amounts
- Creates correct number of side pots with proper eligible players
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing scenarios

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Complex 4-player scenario creating 3 side pots
- All players all-in with different amounts
- Validates correct pot distribution and eligible players
- All 75 tests pass including new comprehensive side pot tests

**Commit:** `40c7669` - Implement robust multi-player all-in side pot calculations

### 2. Button Position with Multiple Eliminations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:eliminate_players/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced simple modulo arithmetic with proper player tracking
- Handles button player survival vs elimination cases separately  
- Advances button to next surviving player when current button eliminated
- Works correctly for any number of consecutive eliminations

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Button on eliminated player with multiple consecutive eliminations
- All but one player eliminated (extreme case)
- Button player survives elimination scenario
- Position reassignment validation across all scenarios
- All edge case tests pass including complex elimination patterns

**Commit:** `89693ec` - Fix button position tracking during player elimination

---

### 3. Blind Posting with Insufficient Chips ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:start_hand/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Prevents negative chip counts using `min(player.chips, blind_amount)`
- Players automatically go all-in when they can't afford full blind
- Proper pot calculation with partial blind contributions
- Maintains poker tournament rules for insufficient blind scenarios

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Small blind player with insufficient chips
- Big blind player with insufficient chips  
- Both blind players with insufficient chips
- Exact blind amounts (boundary case)
- All 25 game state tests pass with comprehensive edge case coverage

**Commit:** `7849980` - Fix blind posting test button position calculations

### 4. Concurrent Game Operations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** All GenServer modules

**Solution Implemented:**
- Comprehensive concurrent operations test suite (13 tests)
- Tests multiple simultaneous player actions and game creation
- Validates Registry lookup consistency under concurrent access
- Process crash resilience and memory leak detection
- Discovered critical deck exhaustion bug for Phase 2 fix

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Multiple simultaneous game creation without conflicts
- Concurrent game lookups and Registry consistency
- Simultaneous player actions with proper error handling
- Game state consistency during hand transitions
- GenServer supervision tree resilience to unexpected messages
- Memory management under concurrent load

**Critical Bug Discovered:**
- DECK EXHAUSTION: GameServer doesn't call reset_for_next_hand() between hands
- Game crashes after 4-5 hands when deck runs out of cards
- This validates the importance of our systematic edge case testing

**Commit:** `c906961` - Comprehensive concurrent game operations testing
