## Critical Issues (üî•)

### 1. Multi-player All-in Side Pot Calculations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex:side_pots/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced simple 2-pot algorithm with layer-based approach
- Handles any number of all-in players with different bet amounts
- Creates correct number of side pots with proper eligible players
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing scenarios

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Complex 4-player scenario creating 3 side pots
- All players all-in with different amounts
- Validates correct pot distribution and eligible players
- All 75 tests pass including new comprehensive side pot tests

**Commit:** `40c7669` - Implement robust multi-player all-in side pot calculations

### 2. Button Position with Multiple Eliminations ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:eliminate_players/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced simple modulo arithmetic with proper player tracking
- Handles button player survival vs elimination cases separately  
- Advances button to next surviving player when current button eliminated
- Works correctly for any number of consecutive eliminations

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Button on eliminated player with multiple consecutive eliminations
- All but one player eliminated (extreme case)
- Button player survives elimination scenario
- Position reassignment validation across all scenarios
- All edge case tests pass including complex elimination patterns

**Commit:** `89693ec` - Fix button position tracking during player elimination

### 3. Blind Posting with Insufficient Chips ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2024-01-XX)  
**Risk Level:** ~~Critical~~ ‚Üí Resolved  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/game_state.ex:start_hand/1`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Prevents negative chip counts using `min(player.chips, blind_amount)`
- Players automatically go all-in when they can't afford full blind
- Proper pot calculation with partial blind contributions
- Maintains poker tournament rules for insufficient blind scenarios

**Test Coverage Added:**
- Small blind player with insufficient chips
- Big blind player with insufficient chips  
- Both blind players with insufficient chips
- Exact blind amounts (boundary case)
- All 25 game state tests pass with comprehensive edge case coverage

**Commit:** `7849980` - Fix blind posting test button position calculations

### 4. Concurrent Game Operations üî•
**Status:** Not tested  
**Risk Level:** Critical - Race conditions  
**Location:** All GenServer modules

**Problem:** No testing of concurrent access to game state.

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Multiple players acting simultaneously
- Game creation during active hand
- Player disconnection during betting

---

## High Priority Issues (‚ö†Ô∏è)

### 5. Deck Exhaustion ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Risk Level:** High - Game crash  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/deck.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Running out of cards during dealing
- Invalid deck state recovery
- Community card dealing with insufficient cards

---

### 6. Invalid Input Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Minimal validation  
**Risk Level:** High - Security risk

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Negative chip amounts
- Malformed card data
- Invalid player IDs
- Out-of-bounds positions

---

### 7. Short Deck Straight Edge Cases ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Risk Level:** High - Incorrect hand rankings  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/hand_evaluator.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- A-6-7-8-9 straight (lowest in short deck)
- Wheel straight variations
- Mixed straight comparisons

---

### 8. Kicker Comparisons ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Basic implementation  
**Risk Level:** High - Incorrect winners

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Two pair with identical pairs, different kickers
- Three of a kind kicker comparisons
- Full house comparisons (trips vs pair)

---

## Medium Priority Issues (üìù)

### 9. Heads-up Betting Rules üìù
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Big blind option to raise pre-flop
- Small blind acts first pre-flop
- Post-flop action order

---

### 10. Minimum Raise Enforcement üìù
**Status:** Basic implementation  
**Location:** `lib/poker_server/betting_round.ex`

**Missing Scenarios:**
- Undersized raise prevention
- All-in less than minimum raise
- Reopening betting action

---

### 11. String Betting Prevention üìù
**Status:** Not implemented
